# Data Visualizaton Workshop

Easily visualize real-world datasets on static web pages using just JavaScript with the Chart.js and Papa Parse libraries. This workshop was last run at [Uncommon Makes 2021](https://makes2021.uncommonhacks.com).

This repository contains the following files:

* `index.html`: skeleton HTML code with `canvas` elements for graphs
* `style.css`: basic CSS styling for center alignment and scaling of graphs
* `finished_script.js`: demo visualizations (prepared before workshop) of what can be done with Chart.js
* `workshop_script.js`: result of the live demo during Uncommon Makes, with participant-selected datasets
* `script.js`: skeleton JavaScript file to create your own graphs

To change which graphs are inserted into the webpage, modify line 26 with the appropriate `.js` file in `index.html`.

CSV and JSON datasets are hosted through [Glitch](https://glitch.com).
